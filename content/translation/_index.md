Machine translation is one of the most demanded areas in NLP today as it allows faster and easier communication with your friends, colleagues, customers, business partners all over the world. Although the quality of machine translation has improved significantly in recent years, it is still not an adequate substitute for translation made by professionals in many cases. Nevertheless, taking into account speed of machine translation, it could be an indispensable assistant in your everyday routine. GroupDocs.Translation apps were created for this purpose. They use neural networks that provide fast and high-quality translation, and usage of our products allows to work not only with plain text, but also with Microsoft Office documents, PDF and Markdown files, preserving their layout.

GroupDocs.Translation Cloud is an on-demand service that translates a wide range of documents, from business contracts and agreements to technical documentation, using the power of neural machine translation. Supporting over **30** languages, the service can process documents in all popular formats while maintaining their original layout, structure, and formatting. Documents can also be converted on the fly, ensuring full compatibility with all editors and viewers.
