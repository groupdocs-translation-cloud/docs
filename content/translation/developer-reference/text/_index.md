GroupDocs.Translation can translate any amount of text in 3 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/translation/authorization/)
2. [Send texts for translation](/translation/text/request/)
3. [Fetch translations](/translation/text/fetch/)

Because GroupDocs.Translation Cloud is provided as a REST API, translation can be performed on any platform with Internet access.

We also provide open-source SDKs for a number of popular programming languages, that wrap all routine operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with GroupDocs.Translation Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
