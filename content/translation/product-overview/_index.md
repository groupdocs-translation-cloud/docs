GroupDocs.Translation Cloud is an on-demand service that translates a wide range of documents, from business contracts and invoices to technical documentation and XML resource files. This allows you to overcome language barriers, making your content accessible to a global audience. This can be especially useful for expanding your reach and serving a diverse user base.

Supporting [over 40 languages](/translation/translation-languages/), the service can process both text and files in [all popular formats](/translation/supported-file-formats/) while maintaining the original [layout, structure, and formatting](/translation/supported-formatting/). Documents can also be [converted](/translation/supported-file-formats/#conversion) on the fly, ensuring full compatibility with all editors and viewers.

With GroupDocs.Translation Cloud, you do not have to worry about complex and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms. Running as an online service, it offers an easy-to-use, fast and secure REST API that allows you to perform the [translation and conversion](/translation/developer-guide/) with a single [HTTPS call](https://api.groupdocs.cloud/v2.0/translation/swagger/index.html) from any device or platform, including entry-level smartphones, Chromebooks and legacy PCs.

GroupDocs.Translation Cloud also comes with open-source software development kits (SDKs) for [.NET](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/translation/net/), [Java](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/translation/java/), [Python](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/translation/python/) and [Android](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/translation/android/), which allow you to focus on your business needs rather than low-level technical details of API requests.
