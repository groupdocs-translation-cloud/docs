GroupDocs.Translation Cloud is an on-demand service that translates a wide range of documents, from business contracts and agreements to technical documentation, using the power of neural machine translation. Supporting [over 30 languages](/translation/translation-languages/), the service can process documents in [all popular formats](/translation/supported-file-formats/) while maintaining their original [layout, structure, and formatting](/translation/supported-formatting/). Documents can also be [converted](/translation/supported-file-formats/#conversion) on the fly, ensuring full compatibility with all editors and viewers.

With GroupDocs.Translation Cloud, you do not have to worry about complex and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms. Running as an online service in the Aspose cloud, it offers an easy-to-use, fast and secure REST API that allows you to perform the [translation and conversion](/translation/developer-guide/) with a single [HTTPS call](https://apireference.groupdocs.cloud/translation/) from any device or platform, including entry-level smartphones and legacy PCs.
