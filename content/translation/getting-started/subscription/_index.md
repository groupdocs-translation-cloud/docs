GroupDocs.Translation Cloud is an on-demand service with a free tier. You must [register](/translation/sign-up/) with **GroupDocs Cloud API** to access the translation features.

## Free tier

This plan is automatically granted to you when you sign up for a new account. It allows you to access all GroupDocs.Translation Cloud features with with a monthly data processing limit. Free tier allows you to use GroupDocs.Translation Cloud API from any number of applications, with a maximum of **150** API calls per month. As long as you stay within the limits, you can also perform concurrent requests.

Apart from the limit on the number of API calls, there are no other restrictions. We do not place watermarks or messages inside translated documents, and we do not limit the size of a document translated per request.

The free tier allows you to familiarize yourself with the service, explore its capabilities, and begin the development. However, once you exceed the limits, you must sign up for a paid plan to continue.

## Paid plans

Paid plan allows you to translate as many files as you need. Each month, we will count the total number of API calls you have made and bill you according to [pricing](https://purchase.groupdocs.cloud/pricing).
