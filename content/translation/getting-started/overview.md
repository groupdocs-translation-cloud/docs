#### Security and authentification ####

GroupDocs Translation Cloud API fully complies with the industry security standards: data transmission is carried out under the JWT authentication that excludes the possibility of snatching information by third parties. For this purpose, you must acquire a ClientID and ClientSecret identifiers to authenticate API requests before being able to use the Reporting Engine functionality.

Have a look at the [“Authenticating API Requests”](https://docs.groupdocs.cloud/total/authenticating-api-requests/) article to gain a better understanding of the underlying security layer.
