Translate text | <ul><li>Maximum **1,000** characters (including spaces and line breaks)</li></ul>
Translate Microsoft Word document | <ul><li>Maximum **1,000** characters (including spaces) _or_ the first page (whichever less).</li><li>Conversion to other formats is not supported.</li></ul>
Translate PDF document | <ul><li>Maximum **1,000** characters (including spaces) _or_ the first page (whichever less).</li><li>Conversion to other formats is not supported.</li></ul>

Regardless of the called method, you are limited by **10** API calls per day from a single IP address.

If you have already hit the limits or need access to other translation methods, consider the [free tier](/translation/subscription/#free-tier) or [paid subscription plan](/translation/subscription/#paid-plans).
